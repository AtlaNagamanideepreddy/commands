            "The reason the sky appears blue is due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**, combined with the properties of sunlight and Earth's atmosphere.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a breakdown:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Sunlight is White Light (All Colors):**\n",
            "    Sunlight, which appears white to us, is actually a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). We can see this when light passes through a prism or when a rainbow forms. Each color has a different **wavelength** – blue and violet light have shorter, smaller wavelengths, while red and orange light have longer, larger wavelengths.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Earth's Atmosphere:**\n",
            "    Our planet is surrounded by an atmosphere composed primarily of tiny gas molecules, mainly nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), along with other trace gases and microscopic particles.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **The Phenomenon: Scattering:**\n",
            "    When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it interacts with these tiny gas molecules. This causes the light to scatter in all directions. The key is that **not all colors scatter equally.**\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Rayleigh Scattering Favors Blue Light:**\n",
            "    Rayleigh scattering states that light with shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) is scattered much more efficiently than light with longer wavelengths (like red and yellow) by particles that are much smaller than the wavelength of the light itself (which is true for atmospheric gas molecules). Blue and violet light are scattered about **ten times more** than red light.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Why We See Blue (Not Violet):**\n",
            "    *   As sunlight enters the atmosphere, the abundant blue and violet light is scattered in every direction across the sky. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all angles, making the entire sky appear blue.\n",
            "    *   While violet light is scattered even *more* than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light. Additionally, there's slightly less violet light present in sunlight to begin with. So, the dominant color we perceive is blue.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **What About Other Colors?**\n",
            "    The longer wavelengths (green, yellow, orange, red) are not scattered as much and tend to travel more directly through the atmosphere, which is why the sun itself appears yellowish-white during the day.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Fun fact about sunrises/sunsets:**\n",
            "When the sun is low on the horizon, its light has to travel through a much greater amount of atmosphere to reach your eyes. By the time it does, most of the blue and even green light has been scattered away, leaving primarily the longer-wavelength red, orange, and yellow light to color the sky.\n",
            "\n",
            "In short, the sky is blue because blue light from the sun is scattered much more effectively by the tiny gas molecules in Earth's atmosphere than other colors. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, painting the sky its familiar hue.\n"
